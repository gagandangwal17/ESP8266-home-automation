# ESP8266-home-automation
ESP8266 : ESP8266 is a highly popular and cost-effective Wi-Fi module with integrated microcontroller capabilities.
It features a single-core Tensilica-based microcontroller, onboard Wi-Fi connectivity, GPIO pins, and other peripheral functionalities. It allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate wirelessly, making it a core component in a wide range of IoT (Internet of Things) projects.

Node MCU : NodeMCU is a development board that is built around the ESP8266 module. It provides an easier way to work with the ESP8266, offering onboard USB-to-serial communication, power regulation, and GPIO breakout pins. NodeMCU comes with pre-installed firmware that enables programming using the low level languages.

This project is a Voice Command enabled ESP8266 based home automation projects wherein I have used LEDs to represent real world devices (ie TV, Fan, Bulb and Geysers etc).
Google Home app has been used to create a real home like experience and for enabling google assistant to respond to user commands.
We can use Blynk/Sinric Pro APIs to enable the google assistant integration with google home. 
I have used IFTTT to create command applets that allows us to integrate the button pressed on either Google Home app or Blynk Application to trigger an action on the hardware.

IFTTT : IFTTT is a software platform that connects apps, devices and services from different developers in order to trigger one or more automations involving those apps, devices and services.
(if this, then that)
